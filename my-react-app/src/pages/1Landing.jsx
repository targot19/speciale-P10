                        <b>Thank you</b> for participating in this experiment.<br /><br />
                        Before the experiment begins, we want to know a bit more about you.<br /><br />
                        When you click "Next", you will be redirected to the <b>first part</b> of the questionnaire.
                            This involves a few demographic questions about your age, gender, level of education,
                            comfort with digital technologies, and how often you use AI systems.<br /><br />
                        The <b>second part</b> of the questionnaire concerns your attitude towards AI systems in general.<br /><br />
                        <i>You need to answer all questions in each part, before you are able to proceed.</i><br /><br />
                        When you have finished the two-part questionnaire, the experiment will soon begin. You are able to see a short briefing before being able to proceed,
                            so you get an idea about what the experiment is about.<br /><br />
